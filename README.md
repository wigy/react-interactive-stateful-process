# Interactive Stateful Process - React Support

Generic base classes and utilities for implementing server-side stateful process
in React. The library is written in Typescript.


## Development

This needs also `interactive-stateful-process` project for demo server. Then demo UI
can be launched
```
yarn demo
```
It works also partially without demo server.
